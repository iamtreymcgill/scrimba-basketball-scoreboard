# 🏀 Basketball Scoreboard

A simple basketball scoreboard project built as part of the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).  
This challenge focuses on practicing **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** fundamentals such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and component styling.

## 🚀 Demo
You can view the live version of the project here: *[(https://basketball-scoreboard-sc.netlify.app)]*

---

## 📖 Features
- Add points to **Home** and **Guest** teams with buttons (1, 2, or 3 points).
- Dynamic score updates without refreshing the page.
- Clear, minimal scoreboard design.
- Built with **vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks).

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started
Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basketball-scoreboard.git
cd basketball-scoreboard
npm install
npm start
```

The app uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development and bundling.  
Head over to the Vite docs for more configuration details.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
This project helped me practice:
- Structuring an app with semantic HTML.
- Styling components with CSS (layout, spacing, typography).
- Using JavaScript for DOM updates and interactivity.
- Setting up a project with **Vite**.
